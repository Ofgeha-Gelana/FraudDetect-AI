# Fraud Detection System for E-commerce and Banking Transactions

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and accurate fraud detection system for e-commerce and banking transactions. The system leverages advanced machine learning models, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition to identify fraudulent activities effectively. By improving fraud detection, the system enhances transaction security, prevents financial losses, and builds trust with customers and financial institutions.

The project is divided into five main tasks:

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**
2. **Model Building and Training**
3. **Model Explainability**
4. **Model Deployment and API Development**
5. **Dashboard Development**

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: This phase involves handling missing values, cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), merging datasets for geolocation analysis, and feature engineering.
- **Model Building and Training**: This phase includes data preparation, model selection, training, and evaluation using various machine learning models.
- **Model Explainability**: This phase focuses on interpreting the models using SHAP and LIME to understand feature importance and individual predictions.
- **Model Deployment and API Development**: This phase involves setting up a Flask API, Dockerizing the application, and integrating logging for continuous monitoring.
- **Dashboard Development**: This phase involves creating an interactive dashboard using Dash to visualize fraud insights.
